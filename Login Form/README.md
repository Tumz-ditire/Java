Create a GUI application in Java that allows users to chat with each other over a network using sockets. 
The application should consist of two parts: a client and a server. 
The client GUI should have the following features: A text field where users can enter their messages 
A send button to send messages to the server 
A text area to display the conversation history 
A login screen to authenticate users 
The server GUI should have the following features: A start button to start the server 
A stop button to stop the server 
A text area to display the messages received from clients 
A list of currently connected clients 
The application should use sockets for communication and handle exceptions and errors gracefully. 
Additionally, the server should be able to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
